1. **Industrial District**: $553 (+$342 vs city average)
2. **South Lake Union**: $361 (+$150 vs city average)
3. **Central Business District**: $301 (+$90 vs city average)
4. **Pike-Market**: $298 (+$88 vs city average)
5. **Lower Queen Anne**: $283 (+$72 vs city average)

#### Bottom 5 Lowest-Priced Neighborhoods:
1. **Holly Park**: $115 (-$96 vs city average)
2. **International District**: $125 (-$85 vs city average)
3. **Haller Lake**: $128 (-$83 vs city average)
4. **Riverview**: $131 (-$80 vs city average)
5. **Bitter Lake**: $132 (-$78 vs city average)

### Room Type Analysis
- **Entire Home/Apt**: $229 average (84.0% of listings)
- **Private Room**: $117 average (15.7% of listings)
- **Shared Room**: $59 average (0.3% of listings)

### Accommodates Variable Analysis
- **Relationship**: Strong positive correlation with price
- **Capacity Range**: 1-16 guests (mode: 2 guests)
- **Price per Guest**: Diminishing returns after 6 guests

### Reviews Analysis
- **Correlation with Price**: -0.120 (negative relationship)
- **Business Insight**: High-review properties may optimize for volume over premium pricing
- **Strategic Implication**: New properties can command premium prices initially

## Phase 3: Hierarchical Structure Preparation

### Sample Size Distribution
- **Data-Rich Neighborhoods (100+ listings)**: 22 neighborhoods (58.0% of data)
- **Moderate Neighborhoods (20-99 listings)**: 53 neighborhoods (39.4% of data)
- **Sparse Neighborhoods (<20 listings)**: 13 neighborhoods (2.6% of data)

### Variance Components Analysis
- **Between-Neighborhood Variance**: 0.0698
- **Within-Neighborhood Variance**: 0.3237
- **Intraclass Correlation**: 0.177 (17.7% of variance from neighborhoods)

**Hierarchical Modeling Justification**: The 17.7% ICC indicates substantial neighborhood clustering, validating the need for hierarchical modeling to properly handle partial pooling.

## Phase 4: Model Preparation Insights

### Transformation Validation
- **Log Transformation**: Reduces skewness from 1.93 to -0.00
- **Normality Test**: Supports Gaussian likelihood assumption
- **Variance Stabilization**: Confirmed across price ranges

### Preliminary Model Performance
- **Without Neighborhood Effects**: R² = 0.495
- **With Neighborhood Effects**: R² = 0.501
- **Improvement**: +0.006 R² from neighborhood effects

## Strategic Business Insights

### 1. Geographic Disadvantage Quantification
The $438 price gap between Industrial District and Holly Park represents a measurable competitive disadvantage that can be addressed through strategic service investments.

### 2. Market Segmentation Opportunities
- **Premium Tier**: Industrial District, South Lake Union ($350+ average)
- **Mid-Market**: Central Business District, Pike-Market ($250-350)
- **Value Tier**: University District, Residential areas ($100-200)

### 3. Service Investment Framework
Properties in disadvantaged neighborhoods can invest approximately $150-200 per night in premium services while maintaining competitive advantage over premium locations.

### 4. Capacity Optimization
- **Sweet Spot**: 2-4 guest capacity for optimal price-per-guest ratio
- **Diminishing Returns**: After 6 guests, price increases slow significantly
